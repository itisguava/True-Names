# What is True Names?
True Names is a Minecraft resource pack that changes the names of many blocks and items. Many blocks and items in Minecraft have different names than many players thought. Did you know that a Quartz Block was called a Block of Quartz. You probably did, but if you didn't, or this aggrovates you, this resource pack is a perfect match!
# How can I support the project?
It's hard for me to translate this pack perfectly into every language, so it would be helpful if you could support the project this way.
